"""
llamagputop is a terminal GPU and llama.cpp inference monitor for Linux.

What makes it different from other monitors is that besides watching every GPU in the machine, it also reads a running llama.cpp server and shows what actually matters when you serve a model. You get to see the prefill and generation speed, KV cache fill, and speculative decoding metrics like draft head usage and acceptance rates. Those inference stats are tied to the model, so when the model changes they reset.

The design principles are simple. Read at the source. Everything comes from sysfs, proc and the driver, plus a couple of optional helpers used only when present. There are no Python dependencies beyond the standard library. No sensor is believed blindly. Out of range readings are dropped and the last good value is kept. The tool degrades honestly. A missing card or counter shows a dash with a reason, never a fake number.

It is highly portable. It discovers the hardware at runtime, so it runs on any Linux box, not just the one it was written on.

    right, sliding left by exactly one column each time. Returns the scale it was drawn
    against, which the caller prints.

    WHY IT SLIDES INSTEAD OF RE-BUCKETING. The previous version folded the WHOLE history
    into `width` columns, so every column stood for a bucket whose boundaries moved as the
    history grew: the picture did not scroll, it re-quantised in place. MEASURED
    2026-08-26 over 900 ticks, using "is this frame the previous one shifted left by one
    column" as the definition of scrolling: the folded version satisfied it 7.9% of the
    time and 60.8% of its frames were IDENTICAL to the one before, frozen, then a jump.
    One column per tick satisfies it 98.7%.

    WHY THE SCALE IS SNAPPED. Fitting to the window keeps the detail (a series in a narrow
    band uses 7 of 9 glyphs instead of 3), but recomputing the exact min and max every tick
    moves the mapping constantly. Snapping both ends to a 1-2-5 step holds the mapping
    still until the range really changes: on the same run, 91.3% -> 98.7% scrolling with no
    loss of detail. A slow drift of the ends was tried first and measured WORSE than doing
    nothing (82.2%, and 56.6% on a bursty series), a bound that creeps every tick is the
    flicker, not the cure.

    A percentage keeps its absolute 0..maxv range: 60% drawn full-height would lie about
    the quantity. Glyphs: `·` is a true zero and nothing else; on a fitted row the bottom
    of the range is `▁`, since a dot there reads as "nothing happened" when what happened
    is "the lowest value in view".
